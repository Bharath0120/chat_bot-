 ## Technical Architecture Overview
 The Q&A agent is designed with a modular architecture to handle web-based documentation and user queries efficiently. The system consists of the following components:
 - **Web Scraper Module**: Uses `requests` to fetch HTML content from a specified URL and `BeautifulSoup` to parse and extract text from HTML tags (`<p>`, `<div>`, `<li>`). This module ensures relevant content is captured for further processing.
 - **Data Storage Module**: Stores extracted text in a `pandas` DataFrame, with columns for the text content and its source URL. This structured format allows for efficient retrieval during query processing.
 - **Text Matching Engine**: Implements TF-IDF vectorization using `scikit-learn` to convert text into numerical vectors. Cosine similarity is computed between the user’s question and the stored documentation to identify the most relevant paragraph as the answer.
 - **Command-Line Interface (CLI)**: Provides a simple interface for user interaction, accepting questions via terminal input and displaying answers along with their source URLs.

 The architecture ensures separation of concerns, with each module handling a specific task (fetching, storing, matching, and presenting), making the system extensible for future enhancements.

 ## Implementation Approach
 The implementation was carried out in the following steps:
 1. **Content Extraction**:
    - The script accepts a URL via a command-line argument (`--url`).
    - `requests` fetches the webpage content, with error handling for network issues (e.g., timeouts, invalid URLs).
    - `BeautifulSoup` parses the HTML and extracts text from specified tags (`<p>`, `<div>`, `<li>`), chosen for their likelihood of containing meaningful documentation content.
 2. **Data Storage**:
    - Extracted paragraphs are cleaned (e.g., removing extra whitespace, HTML artifacts) and stored in a `pandas` DataFrame.
    - Each row in the DataFrame contains the paragraph text and its source URL, enabling traceability of answers.
 3. **Text Matching**:
    - The user’s question is vectorized using `scikit-learn`’s `TfidfVectorizer`.
    - The stored documentation is also vectorized, and cosine similarity is computed between the question vector and each paragraph vector.
    - The paragraph with the highest similarity score is selected as the answer. If no paragraph exceeds a similarity threshold (e.g., 0.1), a fallback message is returned.
 4. **Error Handling**:
    - Invalid URLs trigger an error message and script termination.
    - Network issues are caught with try-except blocks, providing user feedback.
    - Questions with no matching content return a message: "Sorry, I couldn't find any information in the documentation to answer your question."
 5. **User Interaction**:
    - A CLI loop prompts the user for questions, processes them, and displays answers with sources.
    - The loop exits when the user types "exit."

 The approach prioritizes simplicity and functionality, using lightweight libraries to achieve the desired outcome within the assignment constraints.

 ## Future Improvement Suggestions
 To enhance the Q&A agent, the following improvements are recommended:
 - **Recursive Web Crawling**: Extend the scraper to follow links and crawl nested pages, increasing the breadth of documentation available for answering queries.
 - **Dynamic Content Support**: Integrate a headless browser (e.g., Selenium) to handle JavaScript-rendered content, ensuring the agent can process modern websites with dynamic elements.
 - **Advanced NLP Techniques**: Replace TF-IDF with a transformer-based model (e.g., BERT) to improve semantic understanding and answer accuracy, especially for complex or nuanced questions.
 - **Caching Mechanism**: Implement caching of fetched content (e.g., using a local database or file storage) to reduce redundant web requests and improve performance for repeated queries.
 - **Graphical User Interface**: Develop a GUI (e.g., using Flask for a web interface or tkinter for a desktop app) to make the tool more accessible to non-technical users.
 - **Multi-URL Support**: Allow the agent to process multiple URLs at once, aggregating content from various sources to provide more comprehensive answers.

 These improvements would make the agent more robust, user-friendly, and capable of handling a wider range of use cases.

 ## Testing Approach
 The testing strategy focuses on validating the core functionality of the Q&A agent using unit tests implemented in `test_qa_agent.py`. The approach includes:
 - **Test Coverage**:
   - **Content Fetching**: Tests verify that the scraper correctly extracts text from valid URLs and handles invalid URLs (e.g., non-existent pages, malformed URLs) by raising appropriate errors.
   - **Empty Documentation**: Tests ensure the system gracefully handles cases where no content is extracted (e.g., a page with no `<p>` tags), returning a fallback message.
   - **Text Matching**: Tests validate that the agent returns relevant answers for questions with matching content and a fallback message for questions with no matches.
   - **Edge Cases**: Tests cover edge cases like empty questions, special characters in questions, and network failures.
 - **Testing Framework**: Uses Python’s `unittest` framework to structure and run tests.
 - **Mocking**: Mocks HTTP requests (using `unittest.mock`) to simulate web responses without relying on live network calls, ensuring tests are fast and repeatable.
 - **Execution**: Tests can be run with:
   ```bash
   python -m unittest test_qa_agent.py
   ```
 - **Validation**: Each test asserts expected outcomes, such as the presence of extracted text, error messages for invalid inputs, and correct answer formatting.

 This approach ensures the agent’s core components are reliable and behave as expected under various conditions.
